                                social entrepreneur who is often referred to as the ‘Gandhi of carpet industry’.</p>
                            <p>His journey began in 1978 when he started with two looms and nine artisans. Four decades

                                livelihood to 40,000 artisans. Of these artisans over 80% are women, who work out of the
                                comfort of their homes in 600 remote villages across five states in India. He has
                                created immense value in society by using business as an agent of progression and
                                change.</p>
                            <p>Under his leadership Jaipur Rugs has won several global and domestic awards like IFF
                                Design Award, 2019, Green Parrot Award 2019, German Design Award Gold 2018 and European
                                Product Design Award – to name a few.</p>
                            <p>Management guru, C.K. Prahalad featured NKC’s business philosophy in his globally
                                acclaimed book – The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.</p>
                            <p>He was described as the ‘father of modern social enterprises’ by internationally reputed
                                professor of marketing, Jagdish N. Sheth from Emory University, USA. Sheth lauded Jaipur
                                Rugs for being an example of how a business can serve society and be a capitalistic
                                institution at the same time.</p>
